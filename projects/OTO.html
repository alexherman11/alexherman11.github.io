        <h1>OTO Modular Motor System</h1>
        <p>
            The OTO Motor System is a comprehensive modular motor control solution designed for robotics applications. 
            Working in a team of three, our goal was to create a smart, interconnected motor control system that's both powerful 
            and easy to use. This project involved designing custom hardware and firmware to provide precise control of motors 
            with features like PID control, I2C connectivity, and a user-friendly setup interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the hardware and software team, I focused on developing critical components of both the hardware and 
            software systems, helping bring this complex project to life. This experience greatly improved my skills in 
            embedded systems design, control theory implementation, and collaborative engineering in a team environment.
        </p>

        <h2 id="overview">Project Overview</h2>
        <img src="/images/OTO/oto_board.jpg" alt="OTO Board" style="width: 40%;">
        <p>
            The OTO Motor System features custom-designed PCBs that provide all the necessary hardware to control a motor with 
            precision using PID control. Each board includes sensors for current and voltage measurement, quadrature encoder 
            input for position feedback, and I2C connectivity to allow multiple motors to be daisy-chained and controlled from a 
            master device. The boards also include a microcontroller (RP2040) running our custom firmware that handles all the 
            complex control algorithms and communications.
        </p>

        <h2 id="hardware">Hardware Development</h2>
        <p>
            During my work on the hardware side of the project, I made several key contributions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Soldered the power supply components onto the REV1 bare board, allowing us to test the voltages across the board. This required 
            precision soldering using a microscope and fine-tipped soldering iron for accurate component placement.</li>
            <li>Performed hardware testing and debugging, including identifying and correcting issues with diode placement and pin configurations.</li>
            <li>Worked on hardware integration, ensuring the motor control board could properly interface with motors and encoder systems.</li>
            <li>Participated in Rev2 hardware planning, suggesting improvements based on our testing experiences with the Rev1 board.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="software">Software Development</h2>
        <p>
            My primary software contributions included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built and tested full PID control with programmable coefficients, later developing an auto-tuning function from the ground up
                for optimal motor response. 
            </li>
            <li>Developed a current and voltage sensor driver for the INA228 sensor, creating functions to access current and voltage 
            measurements that are crucial for motor protection and performance monitoring.</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented a terminal-based motor setup interface using VT100 commands to provide a clean, user-friendly 
            way to configure and monitor connected motors.</li>
            <li>Worked on hardware integration by ensuring our software could properly control the motor using the Rev1 board, addressing 
            pin declaration conflicts, and troubleshooting motor control issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the project, we faced numerous challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware Debugging:</strong> When testing the Rev1 board, we encountered issues with the board not appearing 
            as a USB device when connected to a computer. After extensive testing, we discovered that connection to the unregulated 
            power supply was causing issues when attempting to flash the board.</li>
            <li><strong>Pin Remapping:</strong> We faced issues with GPIO slices misconfiguration due to pin remapping, resulting in the 
            failure of PID control and one of the motor control outputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Organization:</strong> Initially, the PID functions were blocking other functions from being called in the 
            main code on core 0 of the MCU. We resolved this by reorganizing the code and utilizing the dual-core architecture of the RP2040.</li>
            <li><strong>I2C Communication:</strong> One of our ongoing challenges was establishing reliable I2C communication between multiple motor controllers.</li>
        </ul>
