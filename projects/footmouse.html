        <h1>Foot Mouse for Sally (In Progress)</h1>

            This year I was selected as a hardware engineering lead for the accessible design club, Empower. Specifically 
            I'm working on building a foot mouse for someone who has no ability to use their hands but works on a computer 
            most of the day as part of their job. Five other bright engineers and I will design, prototype, and deliver a product by the end of the winter quarter.

        <p>
            A very important part of this club is that it creates real world impact. Working with Sally has been interesting and also challenging, and has given me insight into 
            aspects of what it must be like to build a product for a customer. Sally has no functional use of her hands (without pain), and has been using a combination of 
            text to speech, auto-scrollers, and a foot mouse called the Footime. When the Footime finally kicked the bucket, Sally was left without many options and 
            sought help from our club, requesting the exact same functionality that she had relied on before. In a sense this is easy, because we only are required to emulate the 
            click, scroll, and move functionality. However, in another sense this is challenging because eye tracking, macro keys, and customization would be so cool to add (spring quarter project?).

            As we are in the early stages of this project currently, I do not have much to show for our product. However, we have begun inital tests of potentiometers and switches connected to an Arduino Leonardo. We selected components that would be 
            easy for less experienced members to get the feel of, and chose to use an Arduino for the rich online community of tutorials and help content. We are working within a fixed budget supplied by the club, and also the specific engineering and design requirements as noted by sally and our team.
