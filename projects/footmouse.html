        <h1>Foot Mouse for Sally</h1>
        <p>

            In Fall 2024 I was selected as a hardware engineering lead for the accessible design club, Empower. Specifically 
            I worked on building a foot mouse for Sally, a kind woman who suffered from bilateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) which prevents
            her from typing on a computer without pain. Along with 5 other engineers, I designed, prototyped, and delivered a product that 
            not only was able to help sally, but also was deployed as a part of the TOM Global Maker Challenge where it recieved an 
            honorable mention in the Daily Living category.

            A very important part of this club is that it creates real world impact. Working with Sally has been interesting and also challenging, and has given me insight into 
            aspects of what it must be like to build a product for a customer. Sally has been using a combination of 
            text to speech, auto-scrollers, and a foot mouse called the Footime. Recently, when the Footime became inoperable and unrepairable, Sally was left without many options and 
            sought help from our club, requesting the exact same functionality that she had relied on before. In a sense this was easy because we only were required to emulate the 
            click, scroll, and move-cursor functionality. However, in another sense challenging because eye tracking, macro keys, and customization would be so cool to add (future development?).

        <p>
            I began by assessing the overall structure of the device and building a simple prototype of the click and scroll 
            functionality. We used simple push buttons and breadboard wires that were connected around the device. 
            This came together quickly and we soon had the bare bones of a mouse. After that, I moved onto the mouse sensor, which was 
            much more challenging. Due to the lack of available mouse sensors online I opted for a custom built housing around
            the PMW3360. A high end gaming sensor, its is actually far more advanced than what is required in our project, but whose 
            breadboard headers and defined SPI functionality would ultiamtely save countless hours on integration. After 
            adjusting the sensitity and settling on a polling approach over interrupts, we configured and connected the mouse sensor with success.

            The biggest challenge I faced during this project came when it was time to tie everything together. It was when I switched
            from breadboard wires to insulated tubing that things started to break down. After I spent hours crimping on male and female headers
            to connect the mouse sensor, it was completely failing to operate correctly. The cursor would incessantly pull toward some 
            corner of the screen and an analysis of the data log showed what seemed to be random values. I connected and 
            reconnected each wire multiple times to no avail. Ultimately I suspected some larger issue and guessed that the long, parallel 
            power and data lines within the wire sheathing may have been interfering. After completely rewiring with single stranded wire
            and the utmost care, I got it working just in time for our Banquet presentation.
