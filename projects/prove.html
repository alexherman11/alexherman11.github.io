        <h1>UART Connected Dashboard</h1>
        <p>
            During my junior year I worked as part of a small but passionate team of engineers for the PROVE (Prototype Vehicle) Lab, an 
            on-campus club with the mission of breaking the world record for longest drive on a single charge. 
            Starting out on the Low-Voltage team, I began by talking with other members to fully understand the entire structure of our 
            system, from the brake sensors to the tablet-interface. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During the time I worked with this club I felt like I made some good friends and learned a lot about the challenges with large projects. 
            I saw how tough it could be to feel motivated when one part  of the project was failing, preventing others from moving forward. While my role and impact may have been small, I feel that the experience of working in a team environment with deadlines, official 
            documentation, and real engineering goals was very valuable and has served me well going forward.

            As part of my application to the club, I was asked to design a dynamic battery gauge element in Android Studio. 
            This did not prove too challenging and soon I was tasked with a full redesign and automation of the interface. I began by working 
            to completely understand the old code base, and found that there were some very dubious things done by the previous 
            coders to get things to work. I spent a lot of time transitioning the code to be page based, so that clicking the settings 
            button actually navigated to a new window. However, this presented the new challenge of keeping processes running in the background
            like a run timer. 
        </p>
        <p></p>
            Ultimately, the primary challenges I faced were related to the learning curve of  
            Andoid Studio. While I found I could get individual elements working and layed out, interfacing the design with java code 
            and making that code recieve data over UART was another story (especially because at this time I'd never heard of UART). Ultimately I drew heavingly on the expertise of my 
            skilled team members who had experience with java to get an elementary packet transfer program running.
            We were able to get the tablet application booted to the device and send it data, however we did not succeed at the time to get 
            the dynamic interface to act as expected.
