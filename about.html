            <h1>Hello, I’m Alex.</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a Computer Engineer at Cal Poly and Captain of the Ultimate Frisbee Team. I have experience working with Python, Embedded C, and kids. I was a beach lifeguard in Santa Cruz for four years and 
                a Junior Guard for nine before that. I am an avid explorer of 
                earth and sea, and love the challenges that lie in facing the unknown.

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            Tell help you understand me, I want you to imagine a peasant farmer tending to his rice, living peacefully under the flourishing Song Dynasty roughly one millenia ago. He leads a life of enviable simplicity, deeply centered in the land and the community. One day, tired of farming, he decides to go see
            the massive tusked beasts who are said to rouse the earth with their feet and dwarf even mountains (Elephants). Despite never 
            meeting someone with different skin than his own (much less heard another language), he sets off on the wonderous Silk Road.
            With little more than a pot, some rice, and the clothes on his back, his journey would probably be like us trying to navigate on Tatooine—filled with danger,
            exotic new ideas, and some real adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though maybe a bit naive, thats the kind of life I want to live. I want to be challenged in new ways. I want to solve problems I didn't know existed. I want to meet people that 
            teach without trying. I want to learn about just about everything and then learn some more. And mostly I aspire to walk through mud and come out smiling.

            <h2>What Matters to Me?</h2>
            <p>
                Having grown up by the ocean, I've seen firsthand how much the environment has changed, 
                even in my short lifetime. Twice in the past three years, massive waves from record-breaking 
                storms have torn apart our coastlines. Warming waters have made algal blooms more frequent, 
                while shifts in marine life happen so quickly that species come and go before we can fully 
                understand their impact. The world feels increasingly out of balance, and we should be focused 
                on restoring the stability we've lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a strong believer that human beings are a deeply integral part of this planet and have a key role in Nature: caretakers.
                We've come so far and learned so much that we seem to have forgot what makes this whole thing so special. 
                While we live away our lives inside little tin boxes with our harnessed magic (electricity), we have grown scared; we are distant from one another and ourselves. 
                I seek to inspire people to find passion in helping others and helping themselves. We've got a lot of problems to solve and I 
                have no delusions of doing it alone. I am interested in joining others like myself doing any sort of work where 
                my skills would be useful.
