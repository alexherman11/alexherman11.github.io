            <h1>Hello, I’m Alex.</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a Computer Engineer at Cal Poly and Captain of the Ultimate Frisbee Team. I have experience working with Python, Embedded C, and kids. I was a beach lifeguard in Santa Cruz for four years and 
                a Junior Guard for nine before that. I am an avid explorer of 
                earth and sea, and love the challenges that lie in facing the unknown.

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine a peasant farmer tending to his rice, living peacefully under the flourishing Song Dynasty roughly one millenia ago. He leads a life of enviable simplicity, deeply centered in the land and the community. One day, tired of farming, he decides to go see
            the massive tusked beasts who are said to rouse the earth with their feet and dwarf even mountains. Despite never 
            meeting someone with different skin than his own (much less heard another language), he sets off on the Silk Road.
            With little more than a pot, some rice, and the clothes on his back, his journey would probably be like us trying to navigate on Tatooine—filled with danger,
            exotic new ideas, and true adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though maybe a bit naive, thats the kind of life I want to live. I want to be challenged in new ways. I want to solve problems I didn't know existed. I want to meet people that 
            teach without trying. I want to learn about just about everything and then learn some more. I walk through mud and come out smiling.

            <h2>What Matters to Me?</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up alongside the ocean, I am deeply troubled by changes I have seen even in my short lifetime. 
                Now, twice in three years our coast lines have been ripped appart by large waves, both caused by record breaking storms. Ocean temperatures have changed enough
                that algal blooms are more common and new patterns of life are coming and going before we can recognize them at all. 
                It really feels like the world is out of balance, and the only thing that we really should be doing is putting it back the way we found it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a strong believer that human beings are a deeply integral part of this planet, and that obviously we are a deeply
                important part of this whole thing that we call Nature. While we may live inside our little tin boxes with our harnessed magic, we still listen for the thunder.
