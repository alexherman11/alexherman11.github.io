            <h1>Hello, I’m Alex.</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a Computer Engineer at Cal Poly and Captain of the Ultimate Frisbee Team. I have experience working with Python, Embedded C, and kids. I was a beach lifeguard in Santa Cruz for four years and 
                a Junior Guard for nine before that. I am an avid explorer of 
                earth and sea, and love the challenges that lie in facing the unknown.

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            I am curious. I like looking and listening and finding out how things work. I love imagining
            what it must have been like to be Capernicus understanding the relative masses
            of celestial bodies for the first time, or Kekulé realizing that hydrocarbon chains could rap around. 
            While it is very unlikely that I will discover the next field of 
            scientific innovation, its not impossible. 
            Just like how the Yucca Moth cant survive
            without the Yucca Plant and the Yucca Plant cant survive without the Yucca Moth, I believe there are incredible
            relationships waiting to be discovered all around us.

            <h2>What Matters to Me?</h2>
            <p>
                Having grown up by the ocean, I've seen firsthand how much the environment has changed, 
                even in my short lifetime. Twice in the past three years, massive waves from record-breaking 
                storms have torn apart our coastlines. Warming waters have made algal blooms more frequent, 
                while invasive species encroach on already stressed ecosystems. I believe it is deeply unfortunate that
                we are cutting back funding from some of the most important research we can possibly be doing - finding ways 
                to keep the Earth our home. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While we live away our lives inside little tin boxes with our harnessed magic (electricity), we have grown scared of the world around us. 
                I care about helping people and helping people help themselves. Now that I've spent years in university learning the 
                dark arts that underly the endlessly mysterious technologies of our today, I'm looking for ways to take back
                the world from the hands of massive corporations that would rather use this power to steal, silence, and sheppherd sheeplike consumers
                who are hardly aware of the dangers they face. I am interested in joining others like myself doing any sort of work anywhere 
                I would be able to learn and grow.
